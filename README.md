# VEHICLE RENTAL SYSTEM - Database Design & SQL Queries

---

## 📋 Business Logic

### Users Table:
- User role (Admin or Customer)
- Name, email, password, phone number
- Each email must be unique (no duplicate accounts)

### Vehicles Table:
- Vehicle name, type (car/bike/truck), model
- Registration number (must be unique)
- Rental price per day
- Availability status (available/rented/maintenance)

### Bookings Table:
- Which user made the booking (link to Users table)
- Which vehicle was booked (link to Vehicles table)
- Start date and end date of rental
- Booking status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled)
- Total cost of the booking

---

## 🔍 SQL Queries
